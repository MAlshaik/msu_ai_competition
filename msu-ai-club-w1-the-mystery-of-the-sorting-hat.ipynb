[Click here](https://www.kaggle.com/pulljosh/msu-ai-club-w1-competition-template) and make a copy to start your own competition submission. (The exact same model we used here will likely get you pretty far on the challenge rule as well.) If you achieve anything interesting or figure out what the rule is over the next week, we will share, celebrate, and discuss your results at our next workshop on Monday, September 19th.\n","\n","2. If you want to learn more about exactly how Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) work, I **highly reccomend** watching [3Blue1Brown's series on neural networks](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks).
